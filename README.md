# ML-Model-
This project aims to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical diagnostic measurements. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and provide accurate predictions.
Diabetes-Prediction – Machine Learning Project
A predictive analytics project that determines whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on health parameters using a Machine Learning model.

✅ Features:

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization

Model training using supervised learning algorithms

Accuracy evaluation and comparison of models

Prediction based on user input
